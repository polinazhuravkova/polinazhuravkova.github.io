                <p>
                    My name is Polina Zhuravkova, <br><br>

                    I am a Production Designer and Set Designer. My primary objective is to consistently enhance visual storytelling through DETAIL-ORIENTED DESIGNS.
                    Rooted in my deep understanding of artistic vision, each project I undertake becomes a challenge to create compelling content that not only educates the audience perceptually but also captivates them visually.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    HERE I NEED TO SHORTLY HIGHLIGHT MY MAIN FIELDS OF OCCUPATION DURING MY PROFESSIONAL WAY. 
                    Throughout my professional journey, I have made contributions to a diverse array of projects, spanning from film and ad productions to music videos and art performances. My passion lies in constructing environments that not only encapsulate the narrative essence but also contribute to the overall visual identity of the production.

                    Currently, I serve as a Production and Set Designer, predominantly involved in the realm of video shooting, encompassing art, films, and advertising productions. With a background in costume and fashion design, I leverage my expertise in form modelling, artistic skills, and creative thinking to manifest them through sets and objects, essentially treating them as another form of fine arts.
                    
                    My career commenced as a Costume Designer, marking my entry into the video sphere. Over time, I transitioned my focus to the set department, where I've been able to channel my professional passion more comprehensively. 
                    Since 2020, I have been filming in Georgia, continually refining my skills  in the filmmaking area.

                    My professional journey has been marked by a variety of projects, showcasing my ability to navigate as an artist capable of working on different scales and mediums. 
                    From crafting expansive sets and stages to undertaking more small-scale projects, such as designing <a href="pic/TARUTS MOMA_SIDUR.pdf"> commissioned objects</a> for MMOMA Museum and contributing to the(<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QyIESABdow"> Louvre Looks Grant </a> ) I've honed my skills in both large-scale productions and objects creation.
                    As of today, my primary focus continues to revolve around film and video production, 
                    a steadfast commitment that has defined my professional journey. Yet, concurrently, 
                    I am immersed in various projects intertwining art and props production, showcasing my proficiency in areas like 3D printing, prop making, and object design.
                    A concrete illustration of my current activities involves the crafting of objects for the 2024 Paris Fashion Week Magazine Presentation (TBT). 
                    This project is collaboration with <a href="https://techuntermagazine.com/macroshots">Techunter Magazine</a>, with whom I frequently work as a set designer.
