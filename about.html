                <p>
                    My name is Polina Zhuravkova. <br><br>

                    As a Production Designer and Set-designer, my first goal is to consistently elevate visual storytelling through detail-oriented designs. 
                    My second goal is based on my understanding of artistic vision. That is why every project for me is a challenge to make great content that will educate the audience perceptually and visually.

                    <br><br>
                    HERE I NEED TO SHORTLY HIGHLIGHT MY MAIN FIELDS OF OCCUPATION DURING MY PROFESSIONAL WAY. 

                    I have successfully contributed to a diverse range of projects, from film and ad productions to music videos and art performances. My passion lies in creating immersive environments that not only capture the essence of the narrative but also contribute to the overall visual identity of the production. Now I’m WORKing LIKE A PRODUCTION AND SET DESIGNER AND BASICALLY LIKE A PERSON RELATED TO VIDEO SHOOTING SPHERE (ART,FILMS AND ADVERTISING SHOOTINGS). 

                    Having a background in costume and fashion design, I can leverage my knowledge of form modelling, art skills and creative thinking and show it through sets and objects, like in another form of fine arts.

                    In the past was working like a costume designer and that was my start of work in video sphere and then I switched focus to set department.
                    Since 2020 Im trying to film in Georgia and improving my film carrier.

                    In my carrier I have the variety of projects where I was an artist who can work not only with big forms like set and stage but also like here (<a href="pic/TARUTS MOMA_SIDUR.pdf"> commissioned objects</a> design for MMoMA museum) and here (<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QyIESABdow"> Louvre Looks Grant </a> ) with objects for the museums and characters. 
                    Nowadays and currently my main focus is film and video production as it was but also involved in many projects related to art and props production (3d printing ,prop making and object’s design). 
                    As an example now I am creating objects for Paris Fashion Week magazine presentation 2024 (tbt) for  <a href="https://techuntermagazine.com/macroshots">Techunter Magazine</a> with whom I often work like a set designer.
